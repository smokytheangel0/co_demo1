This is a website type project started for the Coffee
Oasis in Bremerton, it is a copy of their website 
basically implemented inconsistently. Most of it is hand built with the first page currently a static
image directly from the website which I will turn
into an animation once enough people I know can read
the current source. It was originally implemented as
the head of a coffee oasis branded case management 
app but they are uninterested personally in either
service for free.
