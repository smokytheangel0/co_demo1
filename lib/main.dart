TODO
questions that must be answered as input to an 
automated folder creation tool how many views does
the server app have (can be none)

should be able to fire it back up on an already
created tree and change folder/file names

instead of page names use view names
saying that all programmers do is write code is
like saying all a barista does is speak english

create a rust wrapper for mac, linux, windows and web
this will allow us to be able to push views to all
those using the video game style opengl views :3
