# co_demo0

This is a website type project started for the Coffee
Oasis in Bremerton, it is a copy of their website 
basically implemented inconsistently. Most of it is hand built with the first page currently a static
image directly from the website which I will turn
into an animation once enough people I know can read
the current source. It was originally implemented as
the head of a coffee oasis branded case management 
app but they are uninterested personally in either
service for free.


## Getting Started

This app has not been stored as an entire flutter project due to issues rebuilding on
a computer other than the originator. In order to run this on your own, you must follow
the flutter SDK install instructions below for your platform, create your first project with
`flutter create co_demo`
and then copy the contents of this repo into that folder, replacing all when it asks.

I will include a binary setup script which takes care of the difficulties that arise
particularly when you are trying this from a windows installation.

[documentation](https://flutter.io/).
